## Week 5 Homework 

In this homework we'll put what we learned about Spark in practice.

For this homework we will be using the FHVHV 2021-06 data found here. [FHVHV Data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/fhvhv/fhvhv_tripdata_2021-06.csv.gz )


### Question 1: 

**Install Spark and PySpark** 

- Install Spark
- Run PySpark
- Create a local spark session
- Execute spark.version.

What's the output?
- 3.3.2
- 2.1.4
- 1.2.3
- 5.4
</br></br>


#### Question 1 Solution

'3.3.2'

### Question 2: 

**HVFHW June 2021**

Read it with Spark using the same schema as we did in the lessons.</br> 
We will use this dataset for all the remaining questions.</br>
Repartition it to 12 partitions and save it to parquet.</br>
What is the average size of the Parquet (ending with .parquet extension) Files that were created (in MB)? Select the answer which most closely matches.</br>


- 2MB
- 24MB
- 100MB
- 250MB
</br></br>

#### Question 2 Solution

It is 24 MB

### Question 3: 

**Count records**  

How many taxi trips were there on June 15?</br></br>
Consider only trips that started on June 15.</br>

- 308,164
- 12,856
- 452,470
- 50,982
</br></br>


#### Question 3 Solution

~~~python
df_fhvhv_pq.select(date_format(col("pickup_datetime"), "dd.MM.yyyy").alias("pickup_date")) \
    .filter('pickup_date == "15.06.2021"').count()
~~~


**452.470**


### Question 4: 

**Longest trip for each day**  

Now calculate the duration for each trip.</br>
How long was the longest trip in Hours?</br>

- 66.87 Hours
- 243.44 Hours
- 7.68 Hours
- 3.32 Hours
</br></br>


#### Question 4 Solution

~~~sql
df_fhvhv_pq.registerTempTable('fhvhv_data')


spark.sql("""
SELECT
(bigint(dropoff_datetime) - bigint(pickup_datetime)) /3600 as test
FROM fhvhv_data
ORDER BY (bigint(dropoff_datetime) - bigint(pickup_datetime)) DESC
LIMIT 1
"""
).show()
~~~

### Question 5: 

**User Interface**

 Sparkâ€™s User Interface which shows application's dashboard runs on which local port?</br>

- 80
- 443
- 4040
- 8080
</br></br>


#### Question 5 Solution

You can access the Spark UI on the default Port 4040

### Question 6: 

**Most frequent pickup location zone**

Load the zone lookup data into a temp view in Spark</br>
[Zone Data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv)</br>

Using the zone lookup data and the fhvhv June 2021 data, what is the name of the most frequent pickup location zone?</br>

- East Chelsea
- Astoria
- Union Sq
- Crown Heights North
</br></br>

#### Question 6 Solution

~~~shell
!wget -nc https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv
~~~

~~~spark
taxi_zones = spark.read \
            .option("Header", "True") \
            .csv('taxi_zone_lookup.csv')
~~~

~~~sql
taxi_zones.createTempView('taxi_zones_view')


spark.sql("""
SELECT 
*
FROM fhvhv_data
LIMIT 1
"""
).show()
~~~

Crown Heights North with 231.279 Trips.
